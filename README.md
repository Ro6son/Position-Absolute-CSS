#Goal: characteristics and behavior of the 'Position: Absolute' property

<br>
Note:
<br>
1. What we can conclude about 'position: absolut' is that it always moves in relation to the screen and dynamically according to the screen size.
    2. When the child element contains the position: absolute property and its parent has a static position, the element will lose context. In this case
    the parent element will need to have a position other than static like relative or absolute so that we can position the child element
    according to the dimension of the parent element and not the screen as a whole.
    3. We use the 'transform: translateX and translateY' property to center an element horizontally and vertically on the screen.
